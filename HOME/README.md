# Homepage
My custom homepage


I'm brand new to html and css so I figured I would make myself a nice homepage.
I practiced using responsive design so that the page adapts to multiple screen sizes.
I used my favorite all time color scheme [Base16-ocean](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16)

There is now a search function! Click the greeting to display the search bar. By default any normal query gets sent to DuckDuckGo, but you can also type in a subreddit and search query. 

Example search
```
/r/linux github
```
Would search the Linux subreddit for the word "github". 

### In progress: 
* add weather summary below greeting
